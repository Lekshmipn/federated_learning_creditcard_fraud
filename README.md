# federated_learning_creditcard_fraud
This project implements a federated learning (FL) system where multiple financial institutions collaboratively train a fraud detection model while ensuring data privacy. The system leverages differential privacy (DP) and adapter layers to enable secure model training without sharing raw transaction data.
