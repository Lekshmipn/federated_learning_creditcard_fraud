# federated_learning_creditcard_fraud
This project implements a federated learning (FL) system where we simulate multiple financial institutions that collaboratively train a fraud detection model while ensuring data privacy. The system use differential privacy (DP) and adapter layers to enable secure model training without sharing data directly.
